REFACTORING:
make HeaderButton class do something useful instead of just instantiating ImageButton

FEATURES TO ADD:
configuration program
background image on buttons
custom spacing between buttons
color gradients?

BUGS/ERRORS:
borks if numbers go out of range of the image dimensions
expanding/collapsing bugs out slightly when you trigger another listener while it's expanding/collapsing. Probably something to do with revalidation.
doesn't like paths with backslashes
